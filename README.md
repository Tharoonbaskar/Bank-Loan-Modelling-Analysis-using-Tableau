- Visualization using TABLEAU
- Business insights generation

# Problem Statement
This case is about a bank (Thera Bank) which has a growing customer base. Majority of these customers are liability customers (depositors) with varying size of deposits. The number of customers who are also borrowers (asset customers) is quite small, and the bank is interested in expanding this base rapidly to bring in more loan business and in the process, earn more through the interest on loans. In particular, the management wants to explore ways of converting its liability customers to personal loan customers (while retaining them as depositors). A campaign that the bank ran last year for liability customers showed a healthy conversion rate of over 9% success. This has encouraged the retail marketing department to devise campaigns to better target marketing to increase the success ratio with a minimal budget.

❖There is a chance of 9.3% customers who don’t have credit card and 9.5% of customers who having credit card can avail for personal loan.

❖There is an equal chance of 9.4% customers who don’t use online banking and customers who use online banking can avail for personal loan.


# Project Findings and Inference:

❖ PERSONAL LOAN BY INCOME:
- Customers who have taken personal loan have higher income than those who did not take the loan. So high income customers should be a good target for the bank.

❖ PERSONAL LOAN BY AGE:
- We can observe that age is very close to the normal distribution. We need to investigate further between 38-42 age group customers to see what characters would take a loan.

❖ PERSONAL LOAN BY FAMILY:
- We can clearly see that those customers with family size of 3 who had borrowed loans from the bank is greater than other family size.

❖ PERSONAL LOAN BY EDUCATION:
- Customers with education level of graduate and advanced/professional have higher chances of taking a loan. We should Heavily market to those customers.

❖ PERSONAL LOAN BY AGE & MORTGAGE:
